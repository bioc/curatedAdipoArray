Title: A Curated Microarrays Dataset of MDI-induced Differentiated Adipocytes 
    (3T3-L1) Under Genetic and Pharmacological Perturbations
Version: 1.6.0
Description: A curated dataset of Microarrays samples. The samples are MDI-
    induced pre-adipocytes (3T3-L1) at different time points/stage of 
    differentiation under different types of genetic (knockdown/overexpression)
    and pharmacological (drug treatment) perturbations. The package documents
    the data collection and processing. In addition to the documentation, the 
    package contains the scripts that was used to generated the data.
